##Making vectors

```{r}
####creating vectors

marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow")

##cannot have different classes within a vector, so here everything is assigned as a character, even numbers becuase characters are most flexible. Pay attention to class of objects! To check the class, use class function

class(marmots)

```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 8.5)

```

```{r}
class(pika)
```
practice with vector math:

```{r}

#scalar multiplier - also be careful with what to store v. what to just return without storing

5.2*pika
##the above is not stored, if we want to store this output:

scalar_example1 <- 5.2 * pika

scalar_example1

###more examples

bananas <- c(1,2,3)

apples <- c(6,7,8)

bananas + apples
bananas - apples
```
